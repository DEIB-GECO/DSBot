# DSBot

DSBot is a system designed for dataset QA. The user uploads a tabular dataset (e.g., a CSV file) and express a natural language question/statement (e.g., "Show me clusters in my data"). 

DSBot elaborates the question to produce and execute a data science analysis to provide an answer to the user's question.
