find groups
find clusters
do you find clusters?
Help me
please do clustering
insights
something interesting
apply preprocessing step
see groups in my data
analyze the data and predict the label
do you see any pattern in these data?
fix the data and find the groups in those data
can you extract 4 clusters?
find 5 clusters
extract 10 groups and show me them
use the clustering algorithm for nine clusters
Reduce the dimensionality of the data before locating the classes
Please locate and display the community in the details.
Present me the cluster scatterplot.
using kmeans, divide the data into groups
Compute the pca of the data and find groups using kmeans algorithm, show me visually the performances
classify my data
select age and gender and classify the data
first select x, y and z then classify then extract the importance of the features
select some features, classify the patients and show me the important features
find groups in my data then show me
my objective is to determine the classes of covid patients according only to age sex and gender
classify data and extract the most important features
find rules that correlate the features one with the others
predict the data
select the relevant features and find groups in my data
find the correlation among the data
divide the rows in different sets
predict the disease of a patient using only the relevant features
extract the most relevant features to classify the disease of a patient
perform regression
predict the label of my data
use only weight and height to find rules among the features
find the relations among the features
show me the important features that predict my label
classify data
find the correlation among data
define the important features that classify the covid patients
select only x, t and g to classify patients
use x and y to predict z
study the rules that can connect features
find the strange data
after select some features, extract the anomalies
where are the anomalies?
find the rules that associate features and show them
